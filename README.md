# Simple-slot-Machine
Anyone can view / add / comment on this little project I made. It's a simple slot machine game. You start with a balance of 1000 dollars and it's all luck based after that.



made this as a little beginner project feel free to comment on it. I would appreciate any criticism on my work as I know it has a bunch of errors and is prone to break!
